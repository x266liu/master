This data contains information about the visible minority 
  populations distributed across major census metropolitan areas of Canada. 
  These data are from the 2006 Canadian census, publicly available from 
  Statistics Canada Statistics Canada (2006). For each of the 33 Canadian 
  census metropolitan areas, we have the total population and the population 
  Implemen- tation of all its "visible minorities". These self-declared 
  visible minorities are: "Arab", "Black", "Chinese", "Filipino", "Japanese",
  "Korean", "Latin American", "Multiple visible minority", "South Asian", 
  "Southeast Asian", "Visible minority (not included elsewhere)", and "West 
  Asian". For each metropolitan area, we also obtained the approximate 
  latitude and longitude coordinates using the Google Maps Geocoding API and 
  added them to the data set.
